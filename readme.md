# Fundamental Stock Analysis - An approach

## Motivation:
I am kind of interested in programming and economics. Both combined, has led me to write irregularly but every now and then on this little Python script.

## Application
This application is written in Python. Python Interpreter: v3.10

## User Manual
Unfortunately, using the program with the current version is not very user-friendly.
Therefore, I will try to answer all the important points in this section.

### Prerequisites
Python Interpreter: v3.10 is installed and functioning on the computer.
The Python packages are installed and ready for usage.

### Preparations for use
Preparations are required so that the program can be used successfully and companies can be analyzed for key figures. 
These are described in this section. 

[TLDR]: In order to use the finnhub and alpha vantage stock api you need keys. You can find out how to get a key on the web page I referenced above.
In keys.py you have to enter the keys. api_key for using the finnhub api and api_key_alpha for alpha vantage.

#### What approaches are available to me?
For a better understanding, here a few words about the selectable approaches of the user. 
1. Using a stock API in order to analyze the enterprise data afterwards.
2. Creating your own format, with individually / customized data to be evaluated afterwards. Current format: JSON.

#### Where does the data for a company analysis come from ?
For an in-depth look at financial metrics, four data sources are available: 
1. finnhub stock API (https://finnhub.io/)
2. alpha vantage stock API (https://www.alphavantage.co/)
3. yahoo finance (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
4. use of a standalone data filled file (json format).
